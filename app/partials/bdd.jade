	h2 BDD - Behavior Driven Development

	p
		| Behavior driven development is a type of development, not to be confused with TDD which is Test Driven Development.
		| BDD specifies that tests of any unit of software should be specified in terms of the desired behavior of the unit.
		span.superscript 1
		| In other words, instead of defining a whole bunch of functions to perform your unit tests, you write a lot of
		| scenarios that describe the context in which the test is being written in. Example...
	h4 TDD
	code
		pre
			| function campaignControllerShouldOnlyHaveThreeCampaignsLoadedInitially() {
			| &nbsp; &nbsp; var controller = CampaignsController.create();
			| &nbsp; &nbsp; Em.run(function(){
			| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; controller.set('content', data);	
			| &nbsp; &nbsp; })
			
			| &nbsp; &nbsp; return controller.get('content').length === 3;
			| }
	h4 BDD
	code
		pre
			| describe('Campaigns Controller', function () {
			| &nbsp; &nbsp; describe('#filteredCampaigns', function () {
			| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;it('should have a length of 3 campaigns when loading data and applying no filtering', function() {
			| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; var controller = CampaignsController.create();
			
			| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Em.run(function() {
			| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;controller.set('content', data);
			| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; });
			
			| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; expect(controller.get('filteredCampaigns')).to.have.length(3);
			| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; controller.destroy();
			| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; });
			| &nbsp; &nbsp;});
			| });
	p
		| What if you want to run a multitude of tests that require the same initialization function, like loading data into
		| the controller, Mocha supports a 
		code before() 
		| function as well as an
		code after()
		| function which will happen after all the tests in that suite are executed. There is also a 
		code beforeEach()
		| and an 
		code afterEach()
		| to handle any code that you want to execute before and after each test.

			| before(function() {
			| &nbsp; &nbsp; controller.set('content', data);
