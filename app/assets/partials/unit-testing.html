    The primary goal of unit testing is to take the smallest piece of testable software in the application, isolate it 
    from the remainder of the code, and determine whether or not it behaves exactly as you expect<span class="superscript">1</span>
  </p>

    Unit testing can prove invaluable as your functions grow more complicated and start adding increased functionality. 
    For example, you will want to validate a function that validates a password field to make sure the user doesn't enter 
    something they're not supposed to. This password validation function will probably using a RegEx. Let's take a look...
  </p><code> 
    <pre> 
function passwordValidation (password) {
&nbsp; &nbsp; return /^(?=.*[^a-zA-Z])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])\S{8,}$/.test(password);
}</pre></code>
  <p>
     
    Unless you natively speak RegEx, you will want to verify that this function does only what you want it to do
    and it does what you need it to do. This is where unit-testing comes in!
